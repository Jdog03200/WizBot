If you do not know the id of your bot, put 2 random numbers in those fields, run the bot and do `.uid @MyBotName` - that will give you your bot\\_id, do the same for yourself `.uid @MyName` and copy the numbers in their respective fields.\r\n- For google api key, you need to enable URL shortner, Youtube video search **and custom search** in the [dev console](https://console.developers.google.com/).\r\n- For the Soundcloud Api key you need a Soundcloud account. You need to create a new app on http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new and after that go here http://soundcloud.com/you/apps click on the name of your created your app and copy the Client ID. Paste it into credentials.json.\r\n- For Mashape Api Key you need to create an account on their api marketplace here https://market.mashape.com/. After that you need to go to market.mashape.com/YOURNAMEHERE/applications/default-application and press GET THE KEYS in the right top corner copy paste it into your credentials.json and you are ready to race! \r\n- If you want to have music, you need to download FFMPEG from this link http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ (static build version) and add ffmpeg/bin folder to your PATH environment variable. You do that by opening explorer -> right click 'This PC' -> properties -> advanced system settings -> In the top part, there is a PATH field, add `;` to the end and then your ffmpeg install location /bin (for example ;C:\\ffmpeg-5.6.7\\bin) and save. Open command prompt and type ffmpeg to see if you added it correctly. If it says \"command not found\" then you made a mistake somewhere. There are a lot of guides on the internet on how to add stuff to your PATH, check them out if you are stuck.\r\n- **IF YOU HAVE BEEN USING THIS BOT BEFORE AND YOU HAVE DATA FROM PARSE THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP** you should export your parse data and extract it inside /data/parsedata in your bot's folder. Next time you start the bot, type `.parsetosql` and the bot will fill your local sqlite db with data from those .json files.\r\n  \r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\n##List of commands   \r\n\r\n[**click here for a list of commands**](http://wizkiller96network.com/wizbot-cmds.html)",
